# rstatix 0.3.1

## Minor changes

- tidyr > 1.0.0 now required
- know, `identify_outliers` returns a basic data frame instead of tibble when nrow = 0 (for nice printing)
- new argument `detailed` added in `dunn_test()`. If TRUE, then estimate and method columns are shown in the results.



# rstatix 0.3.0

## New features
   
- `prop_test()`, `pairwise_prop_test()` and `row_wise_prop_test()`. Performs one-sample and two-samples z-test of proportions. Wrappers around the R base function `prop.test()` but have the advantage of performing pairwise and row-wise z-test of two proportions, the post-hoc tests following a significant chi-square test of homogeneity for 2xc and rx2 contingency tables. 
- `fisher_test()`, `pairwise_fisher_test()` and `row_wise_fisher_test()`: Fisher's exact test for count data. Wrappers around the R base function `fisher.test()` but have the advantage of performing pairwise and row-wise fisher tests, the post-hoc tests following a significant chi-square test of homogeneity for 2xc and rx2 contingency tables. 
- `chisq_test()`, `pairwise_chisq_gof_test()`, `pairwise_chisq_test_against_p()` : Chi-square test for count data.
- `binom_test()`, `pairwise_binom_test()`, `pairwise_binom_test_against_p()` and `multinom_test()`: performs exact binomial and multinomial tests. Alternative to the chi-square test of goodness-of-fit-test when the sample.
- `counts_to_cases()`: converts a contingency table or a data frame of counts into a data frame of individual observations.
- New functions `mcnemar_test()` and `cochran_qtest()` for comparing two ore more related proportions.
- `prop_trend_test()`: Performs chi-squared test for trend in proportion. This test is also known as Cochran-Armitage trend test.


## Minor changes

- Now `get_test_label()` and `get_pwc_label()` return expression by default
- Unit testing and spelling check added
- Code rewritten to adapt tidyr 1.0.0


# rstatix 0.2.0

     
## Minor changes 
   
- `get_anova_table()` supports now an object of class `grouped_anova_test`
- ANOVA table is now correctly returned when `correction = "none"` for repeated measures ANOVA
- `NAs` are now automatically removed before quantile computation for identifying outliers (@IndrajeetPatil, [#10](https://github.com/kassambara/rstatix/issues/10)).
- Unquoted factor variable name is now supported in factor manipulation functions: `set_ref_level()`, `reorder_levels()` and `make_valid_levels()`
- New argument `model` added in the function `emmeans_test()`
- Adapting to tidyr v1.0.0 (@jennybc, [#6](https://github.com/kassambara/rstatix/issues/6))
   
  
## New features
  
- New function `welch_anova_test()`: Welch one-Way ANOVA test. A wrapper around the base function `stats::oneway.test()`. This is is an alternative to the standard one-way ANOVA in the situation where the homogeneity of variance assumption is violated.
- New function `friedman_effsize()`, computes the effect size of Friedman test using the Kendall's W value.
- New function `friedman_test()`, provides a pipe-friendly framework to perform a Friedman rank sum test, which is the non-parametric alternative to the one-way repeated measures ANOVA test.
- New function `games_howell_test()`: Performs Games-Howell test, which is used to compare all possible combinations of group differences when the assumption of homogeneity of variances is violated.
- New function `kruskal_effsize()` for computing effect size for Kruskal-Wallis test.
- New functions added to round and format p-values: `p_round(), p_format(), p_mark_significant()`.
- New function `wilcox_effsize()` added for computing effect size (r) for wilcoxon test.
- New function `get_anova_table()` added to extract ANOVA table from `anova_test()` results. Can apply sphericity correction automatically in the case of within-subject (repeated measures) designs.
- New functions added to extract information from statistical tests: `get_anova_label()`
- New function `emmeans_test()` added for pairwise comparisons of estimated marginal means.
   
   
## Minor changes
  
- the unnecessary column `comparison` removed from `tukey_hsd()` results (breaking change).
- New column `n` (sample count) added to statistical tests results: `t_test()`, `wilcox_test()`, `sign_test()`, `dunn_test()` and `kruskal_test()` (@ShixiangWang, [#4](https://github.com/kassambara/rstatix/issues/4)).
- `rstatix_test` class added to `anova_test()` results
- the results of `kruskal_test()` is now an object of class `rstatix_test` that has an attribute named **args** for holding the test arguments.
- In `get_y_position()`, y positions and test data are merged now for grouped plots.
- New argument `y.trans` added in `get_y_position()` for y scale transformation.
- significance column added in `tukey_hsd()` results.
- `adjust_pvalue()` now supports grouped data

## Bug fixes
  
- `detailed` arguments correctly propagated when grouped stats are performed

# rstatix 0.1.1
   
   
## New features
  
- New function `get_pvalue_position` added to autocompute p-value positions for plotting significance using ggplot2.
- New function `get_comparisons()` added to create a list of possible pairwise comparisons between groups.
- New function `dunn_test()` added for multiple pairwise comparisons following Kruskal-Wallis test.
- New function `sign_test()` added.

   
## Minor changes
   
- `get_summary_stats()` now supports type = "min", "max", "mean" or "median"
- the results of `t_test()`, `wilcox_test()`, `dunn_test()` and `sign_test()` are now an object of class `rstatix_test` that has an attribute named **args** for holding the test arguments.
- The results of `cohens_d()` is now a data frame containing the Cohen's d and the magnitude.

## Bug fixes
  
- the argument `detatiled` is now passed to `compare_pairs()`.
